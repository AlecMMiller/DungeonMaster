From the outside you could almost miss @, it blends in so well with the buildings next door.;
From the outside, @ is ugly, cold, and nasty. A low brick and wood building, little light emanates from outside.;Bad
You hear happy noise coming from inside @, and warm light spills out the curtained windows, inviting you inside.;Good
